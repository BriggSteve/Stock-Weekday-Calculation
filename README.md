# Stock-Weekday-Calculation
This is a function-focused program that calculates the average gain/loss percentage by day for each provided stock. It will then print the historical best/worst days as well as the average best days to sell/buy said stocks. The software supports multiple stock ticker inputs at once.


This project will not be updated as I've finished work on an OOP version of this program that works faster and is much easier to improve/work with.
